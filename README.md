# Welcome!

I am an assistant professor in the Management Information Systems Department at the Terry College of Business, University of Georgia. I obtained my Bachelors and Masters of Architecture from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, Master of Community Planning (MCP) from the University of Cincinnati, a Master of Science (MS) in Information Systems, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Information Systems from the University of Colorado Denver. My research interests are in Human-Machine Assemblages, Information Technology Governance, Digital Transformation, Technology Affordance-Based Control, and IT for Development (IT4D). My research has been published in top-tier journals, including MIS Quarterly, Journal of Management Information Systems, Policing and Society, and various conference proceedings.

Prior to joining academia, I was an International Business Development Representative for the City of Denver, Office of Economic Development, where I developed and managed programs to promote exports, attract foreign investment, increase connectivity, and make Denver a more internationally competitive and welcoming city. I hosted trade and investment delegations from China, Dubai, Germany, U.K., Japan, and Mexico, as well as civic groups from Kenya, Zambia, China, Mongolia, Oman, Malaysia, and young African leaders from the Mandela Washington Fellowship.

I also provided staffing and protocol assistance to the mayor’s office and was the staff liaison for the Mayor’s International Advisory Council. Prior to that, I was a housing and urban development consultant, providing market advice and feasibility studies to developers, tax credit investors, and syndicators of affordable housing and community development projects throughout the United States.  I have served as a member of the Board of Directors for Denver Sister Cities International, Denver Coalition for Integration, and the Denver World Trade Center. In 2012 and 2016, I was designated by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce as a member of the Rocky Mountain District Export Council.

I am fluent in five languages, including Chinese, Krio, and French.
