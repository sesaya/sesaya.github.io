The information systems discipline is a dynamic and fast-moving field as research topics constantly evolve with fast-changing technological developments and digital innovations. Given that impactful research often combines novelty with conventionality (i.e., existing knowledge), the seminar will combine foundational IS theories with research on emerging IS phenomena.
The major objectives of the seminar are for each student to develop a good understanding of (a) foundational theories and their IS applications; and (b) recent research on emerging IS phenomena.
