The information systems discipline is a dynamic and fast-moving field as research topics constantly evolve with fast-changing technological developments and digital innovations. Given that impactful research often combines novelty with conventionality (i.e., existing knowledge), the seminar will combine foundational IS theories with research on emerging IS phenomena.
The major objectives of the seminar are for each student to develop a good understanding of (a) foundational theories and their IS applications; and (b) recent research on emerging IS phenomena. Specifically, upon successful completion of this course, each student is expected to:

* have developed a sound understanding of the foundational IS theories discussed in class
* have developed an understanding of research on emerging IS phenomena discussed in class
* be able to critically evaluate the theories and research discussed
* have developed an ability to articulate original research ideas on the emerging IT phenomena covered in class and position their significance within the specific research domain

A short research paper (no more than 10 pages long) on any topic covered during the semester should be developed.
