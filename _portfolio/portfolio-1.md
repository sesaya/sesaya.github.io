Prior to joining academia, I was an International Business Development Representative for the City of Denver, Office of Economic Development, where I developed and managed programs to promote exports, attract foreign investment, increase connectivity, and make Denver a more internationally competitive and welcoming city. I hosted trade and investment delegations from China, Dubai, Germany, U.K., Japan, and Mexico, as well as civic groups from Kenya, Zambia, China, Mongolia, Oman, Malaysia, and young African leaders from the Mandela Washington Fellowship.

I also provided staffing and protocol assistance to the mayor’s office and was the staff liaison for the Mayor’s International Advisory Council. Prior to that, I was a housing and urban development consultant, providing market advice and feasibility studies to developers, tax credit investors, and syndicators of affordable housing and community development projects throughout the United States.  I have served as a member of the Board of Directors for Denver Sister Cities International, Denver Coalition for Integration, and the Denver World Trade Center. In 2012 and 2016, I was designated by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce as a member of the Rocky Mountain District Export Council.
